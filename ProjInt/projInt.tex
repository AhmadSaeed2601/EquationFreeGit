\section{Projective integration of deterministic ODEs}
\label{sec:ProjInt}

This is a very first stab at a good projective integration function.

\subsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Check the order of accuracy of the algorithm.
\item Develop theory quantitively justifying the \dmd\ approach.
\item Develop techniques to automatically make some of the decisions about step-sizes, burst lengths, rank, and so on.
\item Develop higher accuracy versions (once we have some idea about current accuracy).
\item Adapt approach to algorithms for stochastic systems.
\end{itemize}
