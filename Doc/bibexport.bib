                   evolution equations at the (macroscopic, coarse)
                   scale of interest; these are used to perform a
                   variety of tasks (simulation, bifurcation analysis,
                   optimization) using an arsenal of analytical and
                   numerical techniques. For many complex systems,
                   however, although one observes evolution at a
                   macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are
                   only given at a more detailed (fine-scale,
                   microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice
                   Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics).
                   Here, we review a framework for computer-aided
                   multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic
                   computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal
                   scales) using only appropriately initialized
                   microscopic simulation on short time and length
                   scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of
                   macroscopic evolution equations when these equations
                   conceptually exist but are not available in closed
                   form---hence the term equation-free. We selectively
                   discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles
                   and illustrate the approach through representative
                   applications. We also discuss potential difficulties

                   systems with emergent low-dimensional behavior is
                   based on lift-evolve-restrict maps (called
                   equation-free methods): first, a user-defined lifting
                   operator maps a set of low-dimensional coordinates
                   into the high-dimensional phase space, then the
                   high-dimensional (microscopic) evolution is applied
                   for some time, and finally a user-defined restriction
                   operator maps down into a low-dimensional space
                   again. We prove convergence of equation-free methods
                   for finite time scale separation with respect to a
                   method parameter, the so-called healing time. Our
                   convergence result justifies equation-free methods as
                   a tool for performing high-level tasks such as
                   bifurcation analysis on high-dimensional systems.
                   More precisely, if the high-dimensional system has an
                   attracting invariant manifold with smaller expansion
                   and attraction rates in the tangential direction than
                   in the transversal direction (normal hyperbolicity),
                   and restriction and lifting satisfy some generic
                   transversality conditions, then an implicit
                   formulation of the lift-evolve-restrict procedure
                   generates an approximate map that converges to the
                   flow on the invariant manifold for healing time going
                   to infinity. In contrast to all previous results, our
                   result does not require the time scale separation to
                   be large. A demonstration with Michaelis--Menten
                   kinetics shows that the error estimates of our
                   theorem are sharp. The ability to achieve convergence
                   even for finite time scale separation is especially
                   important for applications involving stochastic
                   systems, where the evolution occurs at the level of
                   distributions, governed by the Fokker--Planck
                   equation. In these applications the spectral gap is
                   typically finite. We investigate a low-dimensional
                   stochastic differential equation where the ratio
                   between the decay rates of fast and slow variables is
                   2.},

                   such time-dependent multiscale problems, an
                   "equation-free framework'" has been proposed, of
                   which the gap-tooth scheme is an essential component.
                   The gap-tooth scheme is designed to approximate a
                   time-stepper for an unavailable macroscopic equation
                   in a macroscopic domain; it uses appropriately
                   initialized simulations of the available microscopic
                   model in a number of small boxes, which cover only a
                   fraction of the domain. We analyze the convergence of
                   this scheme for a parabolic homogenization problem
                   with nonlinear reaction. In this case, the
                   microscopic model is a partial differential equation
                   with rapidly oscillating coefficients, while the
                   unknown macroscopic model is approximated by the
                   homogenized equation. We show that our method
                   approximates a finite difference scheme of arbitrary
                   (even) order for the homogenized equation when we
                   appropriately constrain the microscopic problem in
                   the boxes. We illustrate this theoretical result with
                   numerical tests on several model problems. We also
                   demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a
                   convergent scheme without constraining the

                   level of description, for example, lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo, or molecular dynamics simulators, to
                   perform modeling tasks at ``macroscopic'' length
                   scales of interest. The plan is to use the
                   microscopic rules restricted to small ``patches'' of
                   the domain, the ``teeth,'' using interpolation to
                   bridge the ``gaps.'' Here we explore general boundary
                   conditions coupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of
                   the microscopic simulation that achieve high order
                   accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest
                   case when the microscopic simulator is the
                   quintessential example of a PDE. We argue that
                   classic high order interpolation of the macroscopic
                   field provides the correct forcing in whatever
                   boundary condition is required by the microsimulator.
                   Such interpolation leads to tooth boundary
                   conditions, which achieve arbitrarily high order
                   consistency. The high order consistency is
                   demonstrated on a class of linear PDEs in two ways:
                   first through the eigenvalues of the scheme for
                   selected numerical problems, and second using the
                   dynamical systems approach of holistic discretization
                   on a general class of linear PDEs. Analytic modeling
                   shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems,
                   the subgrid fields and the effective macroscopic
                   model are largely independent of the tooth size and
                   the particular tooth boundary conditions. When
                   applied to patches of microscopic simulations these
                   tooth boundary conditions promise efficient
                   macroscale simulation. We expect the same approach
                   will also accurately couple patch simulations in
                   higher spatial dimensions.},

                   ranging from engineering problems to phenomena in

                   stochasticity and the presence of multiple scales.
                   Nevertheless, many agent-based problems exhibit
                   smooth behavior in space and time on a macroscopic

                   the equation-free framework [16--18] can
                   significantly reduce the computational cost. Patch
                   dynamics is an essential component of this framework.
                   This scheme is designed to perform numerical
                   simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on
                   macroscopic time and length scales; it uses
                   appropriately initialized simulations of the
                   fine-scale agent-based model in a number of small
                   ``patches'', which cover only a fraction of the
                   spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we construct a
                   finite-volume-inspired conservative patch dynamics
                   scheme and apply it to a financial market agent-based
                   model based on the work of Omurtag and Sirovich [22].
                   We first apply our patch dynamics scheme to a
                   continuum approximation of the agent-based model, to
                   study its performance and analyze its accuracy. We
                   then apply the scheme to the agent-based model
                   itself. Our computational experiments indicate that
                   here, typically, the patch dynamics-based simulation
                   needs to be performed in only 20% of the full agent
                   simulation space, and in only 10% of the temporal
                   domain.},

                   systems is frequently only feasible over spatial
                   domains much smaller than the macroscale of interest.
                   The `equation-free' methodology couples many small
                   patches of microscale computations across space to
                   empower efficient computational simulation over
                   macroscale domains of interest. Motivated by
                   molecular or agent simulations, we analyse the
                   performance of various coupling schemes for patches
                   when the microscale is inherently `rough'. As a
                   canonical problem in this universality class, we
                   systematically analyse the case of heterogeneous
                   diffusion on a lattice. Computer algebra explores how
                   the dynamics of coupled patches predict the large
                   scale emergent macroscale dynamics of the
                   computational scheme. We determine good design for
                   the coupling of patches by comparing the macroscale
                   predictions from patch dynamics with the emergent
                   macroscale on the entire domain, thus minimising the
                   computational error of the multiscale modelling. The
                   minimal error on the macroscale is obtained when the
                   coupling utilises averaging regions which are between
                   a third and a half of the patch. Moreover, when the
                   symmetry of the inter-patch coupling matches that of
                   the underlying microscale structure, patch dynamics
                   predicts the desired macroscale dynamics to any
                   specified order of error. The results confirm that
                   the patch scheme is useful for macroscale
                   computational simulation of a range of systems with
                   microscale heterogeneity.},

                   simulations of complicated physical processes such as
                   sea ice or turbulent shallow water. Our long term aim

                   coupling small patches of simulations together over
                   large physical distances. This initial work explores
                   the coupling of patch simulations of wave-like pdes.
                   With the line of development being to water waves we
                   discuss the dynamics of two complementary fields
                   called the `depth' h and `velocity' u. A staggered
                   grid is used for the microscale simulation of the

                   staggered grid to couple the microscale patches.
                   Linear or quadratic interpolation provides boundary

                   as floods and tsunamis. The model is systematically

                   problems and analysing the linear dynamics of the
                   system, the centre manifold theory indicates the
                   existence of a slow manifold parameterised by
                   macroscale variables. Computer algebra then
                   constructs the slow manifold in terms of fluid depth,

                   data transfer speeds have failed to keep pace and are
                   the major limiting factor in the development of
                   exascale computing. New algorithms must be developed
                   which minimise the transfer of data. Patch dynamics
                   is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which
                   provides a coarse macroscale solution of a problem
                   defined on a fine microscale by dividing the domain
                   into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch
                   dynamics is readily adaptable to massive
                   parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the
                   dynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch
                   coupling conditions interpolate across the
                   unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and
                   are typically reevaluated at every microscale time

                   patch coupling conditions at `mesoscale' time scales
                   which are significantly larger than the microscale
                   time of the microscale problem. We analyse the error

                   coupling as a function of the mesoscale time

                   numerics for reacting systems. In this paper, we
                   demonstrate the use of local parametric diffusion
                   models; observing the output of short bursts of
                   stochastic simulation, the drift and diffusion
                   coefficients of such local models are obtained ``on
                   demand'' by maximizing an approximation of the
                   likelihood function. The parametric fit utilizes the
                   likelihood expansion of Ait-Sahalia, giving
                   closed-form expressions for the transition density of
                   both scalar and multivariate processes. The fine
                   scale simulations generating the data are the
                   Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm as well as
                   stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The
                   postulated local parametric diffusion models are SDEs
                   with affine drift and diffusion functions; the
                   information extracted from these (estimated) local
                   parametric models is utilized in various

                   how such local diffusion modeling can (1) contribute
                   to linking stochastic simulation with traditional,
                   continuum numerical methods such as fixed point and
                   initial value problem solving algorithms as well as
                   variational integration; (2) aid in extracting
                   quantitative information about the invariant
                   distribution associated with the underlying
                   stochastic system; and (3) be used in computational
