\begin{devMan}
This Developers Manual contains line-by-line descriptions of the code in each function in the toolbox, and each example.  For basic descriptions of each function, quick start guides, and some basic examples, see the User Manual.
\end{devMan}


\paragraph{Users}
Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by \script.
Then read the section that documents the function of interest.


\paragraph{Blackbox scenario}
Assume that a researcher\slash practitioner has a detailed and \emph{trustworthy} computational simulation of some problem of interest.
The simulation may be written in terms of micro-positional coordinates~\(\xv_i(t)\) in `space' at which there are micro-field variable values~\(\uv_i(t)\) for indices~\(i\) in some (large) set of integers and for time~\(t\).
In lattice problems the positions~\(\xv_i\) would be fixed in time (unless employing a moving mesh on the microscale); in particle problems the positions would evolve.
The positional coordinates are \(\xv_i\in\RR^{d}\) where for spatial problems integer \(d=1,2,3\), but it may be more when solving for a distribution of velocities, or pore sizes, or trader's beliefs, etc.
The micro-field variables could be in~\(\RR^{p}\) for any \(p=1,2,\ldots,\infty\).

Further, assume that the computational simulation is too expensive over all the desired spatial domain~\(\XX\subset\RR^{d}\).
Thus we aim a toolbox to simulate only on macroscale distributed patches.



\paragraph{Contributors}
The aim of this project is to collectively develop a \script\ toolbox of equation-free algorithms.
Initially the algorithms will be simple, and the plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.

\textsc{Matlab} appears the obvious choice for a first version since it is widespread, reasonably efficient, supports various parallel modes, and development costs are reasonably low.
Further it is built on \textsc{blas} and \textsc{lapack} so potentially the cache and superscalar \cpu{} are well utilised.
Let's develop functions that work for both \script.
\cref{sec:contribute} outlines some details for contributors.


\chapter{Quick start}
\localtableofcontents
This section may be used in conjunction with the many examples in later sections to help apply the toolbox functions to a particular problem, or to assist in distinguishing between the various functions.

\section{Cheat sheet: Projective Integration}
This section pertains to the Projective Integration (PI) methods of \cref{sec:ProjInt}. The PI approach is to greatly accelerate computations of a system exhibiting multiple time scales.

The PI toolbox presents several `main' functions that could separately be called to perform PI, as well as several optional wrapper functions that may be called. This section helps to distinguish between the top-level PI functions, and helps to tell which of the optional functions may be needed at a glance. \cref{sec:ProjInt} fully details each function.

The cheat sheet consists of two flow charts. \cref{fig:constructPI} overviews constructing a PI simulation. \cref{fig:PIchoosemacro} roughly guides which of the top-level PI functions should be used.

\section{Cheat sheet: constructing patches}
This section pertains to the Patch approach, \cref{sec:patch}, to solving \textsc{pde}s, lattice systems, or agent\slash particle microscale simulators. 

The Patch toolbox requires that one configure patches, couple the patches and interface the coupled patches with a time integrator. \cref{fig:constructpatch} overviews the chief functions involved and their interactions.

    Call \texttt{configpatches1} (for 1D) or \texttt{configpatches2} (for 2D) with inputs which define the microscale problem (\textsc{pde}, domain, boundary conditions etc) and the desired patch structure (number of patches, patch size, coupling order etc).
    
    Output of \texttt{configpatches1} or \texttt{configpatches2}  is the global struct \texttt{patches}. The components of this struct should contain all information required to solve the microscale problem within each patch (function, microscale lattice points in each patch etc). If necessary, define additional components for struct \texttt{patches} (e.g.,  \texttt{HomogenisationExample}).};
    \node [block, below=of configPatches] (microPDE) {\textbf{Solve microscale problem within each patch}\\
    Call the \textsc{pde} solver which is to evaluate the microscale problem within each patch. This solver may be a Matlab defined function (such as \texttt{ode15s} or \texttt{ode45}) or a user defined function (such as Runge--Kutta).
    
    Input of the \textsc{pde} solver is the function \texttt{patchSmooth1} (for 1D) or \texttt{patchSmooth2} (for 2D) which  interfaces with the \textsc{pde} solver and the microscale \textsc{pde}. Other inputs are the time span and initial conditions. Output of the \textsc{pde} solver is the solution of the patch \textsc{pde} over the given time span, but only evaluated within the defined patches.};
    \node [smallblock, above right=-2.2\WD and 2\WD of microPDE] (patchSmooth1) {\textbf{Interface to time integrators}
    
    The \textsc{pde} function (\texttt{patchSmooth1} or \texttt{patchSmooth2}) interfaces with the \textsc{pde} solve, the microscale \textsc{pde} and the patch coupling conditions. Input is the \textsc{pde} field at one time-step and output is the field at the next time-step.};

    This \textsc{pde} is defined by the global struct \texttt{patches}, for example component \texttt{patches.fun} defines the function (e.g.,  \texttt{BurgersPDE} or \texttt{heteroDiff}) and \texttt{patches.x} defines the domain of the patches};
