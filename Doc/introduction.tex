\begin{devMan}
This Developers Manual contains complete descriptions of the code in each function in the toolbox, and each example.  For concise descriptions of each function, quick start guides, and some basic examples, see the User Manual.
\end{devMan}


\paragraph{Users}
Place the folder of this toolbox in a path searched by \script.
Then read the section(s) that documents the function of interest.


\paragraph{Quick start}
Maybe start by adapting one of the included examples. Many of the main functions include, at their start, example code of their use (code which is executed if the function is invoked without any arguments).
\begin{itemize}
\item To projectively integrate over time a multiscale, slow-fast, system of \ode{}s you could use \verb|PIRK2()|: adapt the Michaelis--Menten example at the start of \verb|PIRK2.m| (\cref{sec:pirk2eg}).
\item You may use forward bursts of simulation in order to simulate the slow dynamics backward in time, as in \verb|egPIMM.m| (\cref{sec:egPIMM}).
\item To only resolve the slow dynamics in the projective integration, use lifting and restriction functions by adapting the singular perturbation \ode\ example at the start of \verb|PIG.m| (\cref{sec:pigeg}).
\item Consider an evolving system over a large spatial domains when all you have is a microscale code.  To efficiently simulate over the large domain, one can simulate in just small patches of the domain, appropriately coupled:
\begin{itemize}
\item in 1D adapt the code at the start of \verb|configPatches1.m| for Burgers' \pde\ (\cref{sec:configPatches1eg})%
\ifcsname r@sec:wave2D\endcsname, or the staggered patches of 1D water wave equations in \verb|waterWaveExample.m| (\cref{sec:waterWaveExample})\fi;
\item in 2D adapt the code at the start of \verb|configPatches2.m| for nonlinear diffusion (\cref{sec:configPatches2eg})%
\ifcsname r@sec:wave2D\endcsname, or the regular patches of the 2D wave equation of \verb|wave2D.m| (\cref{sec:wave2D})\fi.
\end{itemize}
\item The above are for systems that have \emph{smooth} spatial structures on the microscale: when the microscale is `rough' with a known period (so far only in 1D), then adapt 
the example of \verb|HomogenisationExample.m| (\cref{sec:HomogenisationExample}).
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Blackbox scenarios} 
Suppose that you have a \emph{detailed and trustworthy} computational simulation of some problem of interest.
Let's say the simulation is coded in terms of detailed (microscale) variable values~\(\uv(t)\), in~\(\RR^{p}\) for any \(p=1,2,\ldots,\infty\), and evolving time~\(t\).
The details~\uv\ could represent particles, agents, states of a system.
When the computation is too time consuming to simulate all the times of interest, then Projective Integration may be able to predict long-time dynamics.  
In this case, provide your detailed computational simulation as a `black box' to the Projective Integration functions of \cref{sec:ProjInt}.

In many scenarios, the problem of interest involves space or a `spatial' lattice.
Let's say that indices~\(i\) correspond to `spatial' coordinates~\(\xv_i(t)\), which are often fixed: in lattice problems the positions~\(\xv_i\) would be fixed in time (unless employing a moving mesh on the microscale); in particle problems the positions would evolve.
And suppose your detailed and trustworthy simulation is coded in terms of micro-field variable values~\(\uv_i(t)\in\RR^p\) at time~\(t\).
Often the detailed computational simulation is too expensive over all the desired spatial domain \(\xv\in\XX\subset\RR^{d}\).
In this case, the toolbox functions of \cref{sec:patch} empower you to simulate on only small, well-separated, patches of space by appropriately coupling between patches your simulation code, as a `black box', executing on each patch. 
The computational savings may be enormous, especially if combined with projective integration.



\paragraph{Contributors}
The aim of this project is to collectively develop a \script\ toolbox of equation-free algorithms.
Initially the algorithms are basic, and the plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.

\Matlab\ appears a good choice for a first version since it is widespread, efficient, supports various parallel modes, and development costs are reasonably low.
Further it is built on \textsc{blas} and \textsc{lapack} so the cache and superscalar \cpu{} are potentially well utilised.
We aim to develop functions that work for~\script.
\ifcsname r@sec:contribute\endcsname\cref{sec:contribute} outlines some details for contributors.\fi
