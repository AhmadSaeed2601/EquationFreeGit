Equation-Free function toolbox for Matlab/Octave
================================================

Users: Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by
Matlab/Octave.   Then read the subsection of
equationFreeDoc.pdf that documents the function of interest.

Developers: The aim of this project is to collectively
develop a Matlab/Octave toolbox of equation-free algorithms.
Initially the algorithms will be simple, and the plan is to
subsequently develop more and more capability.  Read the
Introduction and Appendix of equationFreeDoc.pdf for an
outline of developing the project.
