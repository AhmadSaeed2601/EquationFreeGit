Equation-Free function toolbox for Matlab
=========================================

Users: Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by
Matlab.  The document eqnFreeUserMan-newest.pdf describes
how to use the main functions of interest to you.

Contributors: The aim of this project is to collectively
develop a Matlab toolbox of 'equation-free' algorithms.
Initially the algorithms will be straightforward.  The
plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.
Doc/eqnFreeDevMan.pdf fully details the function code and
many examples.  The Appendix outlines how to contribute to
the project.
