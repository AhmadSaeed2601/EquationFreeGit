Equation-Free function toolbox for Matlab/Octave
================================================

Users: Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by
Matlab/Octave.   Then read the section of
Doc/eqnFreeUserMan.pdf that documents how to use the
function of interest.

Contributors: The aim of this project is to collectively
develop a Matlab/Octave toolbox of equation-free algorithms.
Initially the algorithms will be straightforward, and the
plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.
Doc/eqnFreeDevMan.pdf fully details the function code and
many examples.  The Appendix outlines how to contribute to
the project.
