For developers to create and document the various functions, we use an idea due to Neil~D. Lawrence of the University of Sheffield:
%\autoref{sec:rk2int} gives an example of the following structure to use.

\begin{itemize}
\item Each class of toolbox functions is located in separate directories in the repository, say~\verb|Dir|.

\item Each toolbox function is documented as a separate subsection, with tests and examples as separate subsections.

\item For each function, say~\verb|fun.m|, create a \LaTeX\ file~\verb|Dir/fun.tex| of a section that \verb|\input{Dir/*.m}|s the  files of the function-subsection and the test-subsections, \autoref{tbl:funtex}.
Each such \verb|Dir/fun.tex| file is to be \verb|\include{}|ed from the main \LaTeX\ file \verb|equationFreeDoc.tex| so that people can most easily work on one section at a time.  

\item Each function-subsection and test-subsection is to be created as a \script\ \verb|Dir/*.m| file, say \verb|Dir/fun.m|, so that users simply invoke the function in \script\ as usual by \verb|fun(...)|.

Some editors may need to be told that \verb|fun.m| is a \LaTeX\ file.  For example, TexShop on the Mac requires one to execute in a Terminal
\begin{verbatim}
defaults write TeXShop OtherTeXExtensions -array-add "m"
\end{verbatim}

\item \autoref{tbl:format} gives the template for the \verb|Dir/*.m| function-subsections.
The format for a example\slash test-subsection is similar.

%\item Currently I use the beautiful \verb|minted| package to list code, but it does require a little more effort when installing.

\item Any figures from examples should be generated and then saved for later inclusion with the following (which finally works properly for \textsc{Matlab} 2017+)
\begin{verbatim}
set(gcf,'PaperPosition',[0 0 14 10])
print('-depsc2',filename)
\end{verbatim}
Include with \quad \verb|\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{filename}|

\end{itemize}
