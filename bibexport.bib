  abstract =      {Data-driven dynamical systems is a burgeoning
                   field---it connects how measurements of nonlinear
                   dynamical systems and/or complex systems can be used
                   with well-established methods in dynamical systems
                   theory. This is a critically important new direction
                   because the governing equations of many problems
                   under consideration by practitioners in various
                   scientific fields are not typically known. Thus,
                   using data alone to help derive, in an optimal sense,
                   the best dynamical system representation of a given
                   application allows for important new insights. The
                   recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
                   is an innovative tool for integrating data with
                   dynamical systems theory. The DMD has deep
                   connections with traditional dynamical systems theory
                   and many recent innovations in compressed sensing and
                   machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition:
                   Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems, the first
                   book to address the DMD algorithm, presents a
                   pedagogical and comprehensive approach to all aspects
                   of DMD currently developed or under development;
                   blends theoretical development, example codes, and
                   applications to showcase the theory and its many
                   innovations and uses; highlights the numerous
                   innovations around the DMD algorithm and demonstrates
                   its efficacy using example problems from engineering
                   and the physical and biological sciences; and
                   provides extensive MATLAB code, data for intuitive
                   examples of key methods, and graphical presentations.
                   The core audience for this book is engineers and
                   applied mathematicians working in the physical and
                   biological sciences. It can be used in courses that
                   integrate data analysis with dynamical systems.},

  abstract =      {We are developing a framework for multiscale
                   computation which enables models at a ``microscopic''
                   level of description, for example, lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo, or molecular dynamics simulators, to
                   perform modeling tasks at ``macroscopic'' length
                   scales of interest. The plan is to use the
                   microscopic rules restricted to small ``patches'' of
                   the domain, the ``teeth,'' using interpolation to
                   bridge the ``gaps.'' Here we explore general boundary
                   conditions coupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of
                   the microscopic simulation that achieve high order
                   accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest
                   case when the microscopic simulator is the
                   quintessential example of a PDE. We argue that
                   classic high order interpolation of the macroscopic
                   field provides the correct forcing in whatever
                   boundary condition is required by the microsimulator.
                   Such interpolation leads to tooth boundary
                   conditions, which achieve arbitrarily high order
                   consistency. The high order consistency is
                   demonstrated on a class of linear PDEs in two ways:
                   first through the eigenvalues of the scheme for
                   selected numerical problems, and second using the
                   dynamical systems approach of holistic discretization
                   on a general class of linear PDEs. Analytic modeling
                   shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems,
                   the subgrid fields and the effective macroscopic
                   model are largely independent of the tooth size and
                   the particular tooth boundary conditions. When
                   applied to patches of microscopic simulations these
                   tooth boundary conditions promise efficient
                   macroscale simulation. We expect the same approach
                   will also accurately couple patch simulations in
                   higher spatial dimensions.},

  abstract =      {Massive parallelisation has lead to a dramatic
                   increase in available computational power. However,
                   data transfer speeds have failed to keep pace and are
                   the major limiting factor in the development of
                   exascale computing. New algorithms must be developed
                   which minimise the transfer of data. Patch dynamics
                   is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which
                   provides a coarse macroscale solution of a problem
                   defined on a fine microscale by dividing the domain
                   into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch
                   dynamics is readily adaptable to massive
                   parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the
                   dynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch
                   coupling conditions interpolate across the
                   unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and
                   are typically reevaluated at every microscale time
                   step, thus requiring almost continuous data transfer.
                   We propose a modified patch dynamics scheme which
                   minimises data transfer by only reevaluating the
                   patch coupling conditions at `mesoscale' time scales
                   which are significantly larger than the microscale
                   time of the microscale problem. We analyse the error
                   arising from patch dynamics with mesoscale temporal
                   coupling as a function of the mesoscale time
                   interval, patch size, and ratio between the
                   microscale and macroscale.},

  abstract =      {In traditional physicochemical modeling, one derives
                   evolution equations at the (macroscopic, coarse)
                   scale of interest; these are used to perform a
                   variety of tasks (simulation, bifurcation analysis,
                   optimization) using an arsenal of analytical and
                   numerical techniques. For many complex systems,
                   however, although one observes evolution at a
                   macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are
                   only given at a more detailed (fine-scale,
                   microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice
                   Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics).
                   Here, we review a framework for computer-aided
                   multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic
                   computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal
                   scales) using only appropriately initialized
                   microscopic simulation on short time and length
                   scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of
                   macroscopic evolution equations when these equations
                   conceptually exist but are not available in closed
                   form---hence the term equation-free. We selectively
                   discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles
                   and illustrate the approach through representative
                   applications. We also discuss potential difficulties
                   and outline areas for future research.},
