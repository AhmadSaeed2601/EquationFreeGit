\section{Introduction}


The patch scheme applies to spatio-temporal systems where
the spatial domain is larger than what can be computed in
reasonable time in a given complicated microscale code.  In
the scheme we compute the microscale details only on small
patches of the space-time domain, and produce correct
macroscale predictions by craftily coupling the patches
across unsimulated space \cite[e.g.]{Hyman2005, Samaey03b,
Samaey04, Roberts06d, Liu2015}.  The resulting macroscale
predictions were generally proved to be consistent with the
microscale dynamics, to some specified order of accuracy, in
a series of papers: 1D-space dissipative systems
\cite[]{Roberts06d, Bunder2013b}; 2D-space dissipative
systems \cite[]{Roberts2011a}; and 1D-space wave-like
systems \cite[]{Cao2014a}.

The microscale spatial structure is to be on a lattice such
as obtained from finite difference approximation of a \pde.
Usually continuous in time.

\paragraph{Quick start}
See \cref{sec:configPatches1eg,sec:configPatches2eg} which
respectively list example basic code that uses the provided 
functions to simulate the 1D Burgers'~\pde, and a 2D 
nonlinear `diffusion'~\pde.

\section{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing needs to be quantitative.
\item more than two space dimensions??
\item Heterogeneous microscale via averaging regions---but I suspect should be separated from simple homogenisation
\item Parallel processing versions.
\item ??
\item Adapt to maps in micro-time?  Surely easy, just an example.
\end{itemize}
