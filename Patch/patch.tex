\section{Patch scheme for given microscale discrete space system}
\label{sec:patch}

The spatial discrete system is to be on a lattice such as obtained from finite difference approximation of a \pde.
Usually continuous in time.

\subsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing is so far only qualitative.  Need to be quantitative.
\item Multiple space dimensions.
\item Heterogeneous microscale via averaging regions.
\item Parallel processing versions.
\item ??
\item Adapt to maps in micro-time?
\end{itemize}
