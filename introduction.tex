\section{Introduction}
\localtableofcontents

\paragraph{Users}
Place this toolbox's folder in a path searched by \script.
Then read the subsection that documents the function of interest.


\paragraph{Blackbox scenario}
Assume that a researcher\slash practitioner has a detailed and \emph{trustworthy} computational simulation of some problem of interest.
The simulation may be written in terms of micro-positional coordinates~\(\xv_i(t)\) in `space' at which there are micro-field variable values~\(\uv_i(t)\) for indices~\(i\) in some (large) set of integers and for time~\(t\).
In lattice problems the positions~\(\xv_i\) would be fixed in time (unless employing a moving mesh on the microscale); in particle problems the positions would evolve.
The positional coordinates are \(\xv_i\in\RR^{d}\) where for spatial problems integer \(d=1,2,3\), but it may be more when solving for a distribution of velocities, or pore sizes, or trader's beliefs, etc.
The mirco-field variables could be in~\(\RR^{p}\) for any \(p=1,2,\ldots,\infty\).

Further, assume that the computational simulation is too expensive over all the desired spatial domain~\(\XX\subset\RR^{d}\).
Thus we aim a toolbox to simulate only on macroscale distributed patches.



\paragraph{Contributors}
The aim of this project is to collectively develop a \script\ toolbox of equation-free algorithms.
Initially the algorithms will be simple, and the plan is to subsequently develop more and more capability.

\textsc{Matlab} appears the obvious choice for a first version since it is widespread, reasonably efficient, supports various parallel modes, and development costs are reasonably low.
Further it is built on \textsc{blas} and \textsc{lapack} so potentially the cache and superscalar \cpu{} are well utilised.
Let's develop functions that work for both \script.
\cref{sec:contribute} outlines some details for contributors.
